                <h2>Comfortably Numb Solo - Pink Floyd</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a lightly modified version of the live solo played from the PULSE album.

                <h2>Klimbim - Don Ross</h2>
                <p>
                    One of my favourite pieces by this guitar maestro - energetic, fun, and a delight to play!

                <h2>Stairway to Heaven Solo - Led Zeppelin</h2>
                <p>
                    Could be argued the greatest song of all time, could be argued the greatest guitar solo of all time.
                    Cannot be argued that this is one of my favourite pieces, and has been for most of my life. Had to be done.
