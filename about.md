I try to balance my life between enjoying technology,
and finding deep satisfaction in the outdoors. Growing
up in the Lake District, you can imagine the surprise
to my parents when I showed no interest in the outdoors
whatsoever when I was younger, and it took moving to
Coventry to attend the University to realise I enjoyed
the gorgeous landscape of the Lakes. I decided the
easiest way to return to similar places was to join
the Mountaineering Society, and so began my journey
into climbing.

Within 7 months, I was elected President of the society,
undertook Mountain Leader training, went on an Alpine
Mountaineering course in Chamonix, and spent that summer
in Ailefroide and the Dolomites. 

## Memorable Climbs

 * Flying Buttress (Dinas Cromlech) - Cold and wet in January.
 * Aiguille du Tour - First Alpine summit.
 * Gambit Climb, North Wales - First Severe multipitch.
 * Cosmique's Arete - Just after a two day storm, leaving the route
 covered in snow, crux crack ended up being one of the simpler bits
 of climbing.
 * Dent du Geant - First 4000+ summit.
