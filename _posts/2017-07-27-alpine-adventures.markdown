This summer saw me take the plunge for a three week excursion to Chamonix, from 24th June to the 16th July.

## Petite Verte

The first route we attempted was one I had heard about from friends who had completed it whilst on Alpine
training courses - so it seemed an appropriate place to dip our feet back into the Alps. Gearing up for the
first time that trip was as exhilerating as ever, and the short, easy approach to the bergschrund flew by -
culminating with breathtaking snippets of views over to *Les Drus* through gaps in the clouds. 

After hitting the Bergschrund, the guidebook suggested a snow slope up to the crest of the ridge, however
a bout of hot weather had turned the slope into an ice pitch. Climbing up with a single mountaineering axe
was weird for such a pitch - but nevertheless we made it up safely. The ridge was gorgeous, straightforward
scrambling, with some minor climbing pitches - but nothing tricky.

We made it to a small overhang of rock whilst we waited for the team in front to move on. An hour and a half
later, after finding it would be sketchy to cross over them, and they were held up by a team retreating down
the ice field in front of them, and the ever-darkening clouds, we decided to call it a day, and headed back
along the ridge to abseil off. By this time, we were abbing into nothingess, and although a shame to retreat
on the first route - a good day had by all.

## Cosmiques Arete

Well before heading out to Chamonix, we had decided that Cosmiques must be on the list - so a couple of days
after our attempt on the Petite Verte, we stormed towards the famous arete. After the blistering heat, two
days of storm had arrived, cooling the valley and mountains down substantially, and depositing a fresh batch
of snow on the route. This made for an even more picturesque ascent!

With the addition of drilled crampon pockets, the "crux" wall was by no means the trickiest section of the
route, instead some of the scrambly sections that were simply covered in snow proved to be more
challenging. I could see quickly why this route was a classic. A short walk from the cable car, a fabulous
approach, a dramatic, yet not technically difficult, exposed ascent, and a grand finale up onto the Midi
station platform - greeted with applause, photos and very excited tourists. Nearly as excited as us to
be there!

## Dent du Geant

Way back in January 2016, a friend of mine approached me and a friend with the idea of climbing a huge
spike of rock sticking above the other peaks - at a staggering 4013m. Needless to say, we were taken
with the idea almost instantly. The spike of rock is more commonly known as the Dent du Geant, or
Giants Tooth.

To give ourselves the best shot we could, we took the panoramic lift over the afternoon before, and
set up a bivvy just below the first couloir. We then settled down to the most stunning sunset I have
ever seen.
