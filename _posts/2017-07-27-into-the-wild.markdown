*By Jon Krakauer*

Into the Wild brings to reality the blissfully simplistic concept of running
from civilization to test ourselves against a life in the wild. Chris McCandless
had this dream, and Into the Wild depicts his epic embarkment on a pilgrimage
of personal development.

Krakauer draws upon his own life experience to help justify McCandless motives
and decision to abandon civilisation and to lead a solitary life in the wild
to the reader, and does so extremely effectively, strengthened with comparisons 
to the likes of John Muir, and the less well known Everett Ruess.

The book is not written chronologically, with chapters about McCandless' earlier
life interspersing the narrative, usually with a link to explain a motive or 
decision he made later. Also throughout the text are occasional chapters or passages
about Krakauer's life, I think to enforce how similar he was to McCandless in many
ways. He openly documents that this leads to a certain level of bias towards the
decisions McCandless made, even when they lead to such pain for his family.

He also utilises his normal technique (also seen in Into Thin Air), of introducing 
each chapter with a short text, quoting someone/something else - however this 
time he paints a greater abstracted picture of McCandless mind, by including
passages from the books that McCandless carried with him into the wilds of
Alaska, emphasizing their importance to him, along with stating they were by far
the heaviest things within his pack. Perhaps they give a person more understanding
of his mind that he could have done with his various notes.

If you've never read any work written by Jon Krakauer, Into the Wild is a
great book to start with. An easy writing style, compelling story, researched, 
understook, and fabulously written by a competent adventurer leaving you
wanting to continue reading long after you finish the book.


*Read Into the Wild? Try **Into Thin Air** by Jon Krakauer - his account of the
devastating storm on Everest whilst he and his companions attempted an
ascent in 1996 that left 8 climbers dead. Review coming soon...*
