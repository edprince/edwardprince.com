*By Jon Krakauer*

Into the Wild brings to reality the blissfully simplistic concept of running
from civilization to test ourselves against a life in the wild. Chris McCandless
had this dream, however unlike most of us, fulfilled his wishes and set off
on a quest of personal progression.

Krakauer draws upon his own life experience to help justify McCandless motives
and decisions to the reader, and does so extremely effectively, strengthening
with comparisons to the likes of John Muir, and the less well known Everett Ruess.

He also utilises his normal technique (also seen in Into Thin Air), of introducing 
each chapter with a short text, quoting someone/something else - however this 
time he paints a greater abstracted picture of McCandless mind, by including
passages from the books that McCandless carried with him into the wilds of
Alaska, emphasizing their importance to him, along with stating they were by far
the heaviest things within his pack. Perhaps they give a person more understanding
of his mind that he could have done with his various notes.
