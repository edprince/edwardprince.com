# Confession

Before we get started, I have to confess that I am new to Polymer, 
never used previous versions, so this series is as much for me as
I progress on my own journey with Polymer, and hopefully it can be
useful as a different perspective some others.

The other imporant note, is that this is a tutorial for Linux users.
I'm not sure where the differences lie between the setup and use
for Winodws/Mac, so I won't cover them.

## What is Polymer?

Polymer is a way of building web applications using reusable
components.

## Installation and Setup

One of the big differences between Polymer 2.0 and 3.0 is the use
of *npm* over *bower* - so we will be using *npm* a lot, so make sure
you have NodeJS installed.

To get started, we need to install the polymer command line interface
with: 

`npm install -g polymer-cli`

Now, at first I tried to use the *polymer-3-starter-kit*, but hit
problems right from the beginning. I had much more luck cloning
[this](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/start-polymer3) repository.

`git clone https://github.com/PolymerLabs/start-polymer3.git`

`cd start-polymer3`

Moves into the new directory.

`npm install`

Installs all dependencies required.

`polymer serve`

Serve onto localhost.


## Using Components

Install your component from npm. 

`npm install @polymer/web-component`

This adds the component to your `node_modules/` directory. Then
in the file you wish to use this component, import it using:

`import "@polyerm/web-component/web-component.js";`
