<em>View from the top of 1,2,3 Wall</em></p>

<p>There’s plenty of information out there on actual routes at Tonsai,
so this article is going to focus on the logistics of organising
a climbing trip to Southern Thailand.</p>

<h1 id="travelling-from-bangkok">Travelling from Bangkok</h1>

<p>Your choices for getting south are flying, sleeper train or
coach - probably in that order for comfort (but train is
best value for money!). To book train (£30) or coach tickets (£16),
head to
any information office in Bangkok, and ask for tickets to
get to Krabi, they’ll tell you what’s available, and you
can choose the overnight option (the train gives you a bed,
and the coach has reclining seats). Go for the overnight option,
meaning you won’t waste a proper day travelling. 
The train will get you to Suttherani, where you will be met in 
the morning by someone who is taking a bus to Krabi.</p>

<p>When I did this journey, there was a couple of stops on route, 
changing to a coach before continuing. When you arrive at Krabi, 
you’ll probably be dropped outside town and will need to get 
a taxi to Ao Nang.</p>

<p>From Ao Nang, find the pier, and there will be a desk selling
tickets for Tonsai and Railay. These will be <strong>100 baht</strong> per
person.</p>

<p>From there, enjoy the boat ride and the wonderful feeling jumping
off the longtail boat into the shallow sea.</p>

<h1 id="climbing">Climbing</h1>

<p>It’s hard. Like, really hard.
When people say Tonsai is a climber’s paradise, they’re 
not lying. But perhaps they should be saying Tonsai is 
a <em>good</em> climber’s paradise. Unless you’re comfortably 
leading 6a-6b, you (like me) will probably find there’s not 
exactly an abundance of routes. But don’t despair, there are some
easier climbs around. The most fruitful
area for lower grades is 1,2,3 Area, at the end of East Railay
beach. Here, there are a handful of 5’s, and a 4+. The ridiculous
amount of polish makes them feel steep for the grade though.</p>

<p>Check it out on <a href="https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crag.php?id=2257#overview">UKC</a>.</p>

<h1 id="accommodation">Accommodation</h1>

<h2 id="tonsai">Tonsai</h2>

<p>There are a few options in Tonsai. By far the nicest is the
<a href="http://www.tonsaibaykrabi.com/">Tonsai Bay Resort</a>, but this 
is also expensive and busy. If its not for you, there are 
more options at the other end of the beach. Take the path up, 
and there are a few tiers of accommodation. None of these have 
air-con though, just a fan, and there’s no electricty between 
6am - 6pm, so the rooms get pretty stuffy.</p>

<h2 id="railay">Railay</h2>

<p>There’s loads of options in Railay, all a lot more tourist-y,
but with AC, and electricty. One tip we picked up whilst here,
is that lots of the rooms have a key that must be placed in
a slot inside the room to activate electricty - however if
you have a fridge in the room, that will often be on a separate
power source, so if you take that out, you can still charge
stuff when you’re not around.</p>

<h1 id="top-5-tips">Top 5 Tips</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Think carefully about what gear you bring</strong></p>

    <p>There are loads of gear shops, and the price to hire a rope
for a week is probably the cost it would have been to add
an extra bag to the flight anyway, <strong>and</strong> you have the
benefit of not lugging it around elsewhere. You can also
hire guidebooks at the shops - they can be tricky to find
online. I’d definitely bring your own shoes and harness, and
draws are up to you, easy to carry, also easy to hire, along
with helmets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Buy a beach mat!</strong></p>

    <p>One of the first things you’ll notice is that <em>everybody</em>
is using beach mats. This is for a good reason. There is sand
everywhere. If you’re careful, you’ll still get sand everywhere.
It makes your life so much easier using a massive mat. And they’re
super cheap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do your research</strong></p>

    <p>There are some routes that the guidebooks purposefully say are no
longer deemed safe. Make sure you do your research before climbing
a route that may potentially have dodgy bolts/loose rock. A 
good rule of thumb is if your (up to date) guidebook says its 
okay, and you see other climbers on the routes - then its 
probably alright.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bring some seriously sticky chalk…</strong></p>

    <p>Unless you’re very acclimatised, you’ll sweat like there’s no 
tomorrow. And this doesn’t make climbing extremely polished 
limestone any easier. We used liquid chalk, with a chalk ball 
to keep topping up on the climb. This was a pretty effective method.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make sure its the right destination</strong></p>

    <p>Tonsai is an amazing place, filled with magnificent climbs, but if
you’re set on climbing every day, and aren’t comfortable
climbing 6’s, it might be more worthwhile heading somewhere else.
That being said, there’s so much else to do in Tonsai if you’re
happy to spend some time not climbing!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Whilst in Tonsai, give yourself some breaks, and try some other
stuff out. I’d highly recommend hiring paddleboards, kayaks, going
swimming, taking the ludicrous path to the Phra Nang Lagoon and
going Scuba Diving. Tonsai is a stunning part of the world, and
you’ll probably not want to come home once settling into the
relaxed lifestyle out there. I hope there are some useful nuggets
of information for you in this article, and happy climbing!</p>
