  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>As the summer pietered out, I realised I was going to miss the dry rock climbing
in the UK throughout the winter (although it does allow for my main wave of excitement
to sweep through in anticipation of a cold winter). Now working remotely for UKC, and
my brother in a similar position with another company, we decided to take a trip out
to Thailand for some climbing in the sun.</p>

<h2 id="bangkok">Bangkok</h2>

<p>I have never been to Asia before, and what a way to arrive. Bangkok is the most
extraordinary city, as much as an adventure for your nose as it is yourself as
you wander down streets, crammed with stalls selling the best streetfood I have
ever had. It took all of about 10 minutes, a phenomenal meal that was less than
£1 to convince me I was in a fantastic city. We stayed for a couple of days,
visiting parks, markets, and mostly eating some wonderful food.</p>

<h2 id="moving-south">Moving South</h2>

<p>The destination for the trip was Tonsai - our sights set for some warm weather
Limestone climbing. We took a sleeper train down from Bangkok down to Suttherani,
before taking a minibus, coach, second minibus and longtail boat, dropping us
at one of the more stunning locations I have ever been. We spent the day at Tonsai,
swimming, learning our way round, and getting an early night (some pretty seious jetlag)
still going on.</p>

<h2 id="the-climbing">The Climbing</h2>

<p>We knew from a guidebook and UKC that the climbing was hard, but we didn’t anticipate
how few places there were with easier grades. One of these places is 1,2,3 Wall - at
the end of East Railay beach. The climbing was hot, polished, hot and incredibly hot!
Three or four moves in would render the climber drenched in sweat, and the liquid chalk
became a godsend. The extremely polished rock makes the climbing often feel tougher than
the grade - but nevertheless we had a great time. It quickly transpired that all of the
climbing within our ability was over at East Railay, so we packed up our stuff from Tonsai
and found a place to stay a bit closer.</p>

<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>

<p>When not climbing, there is plenty to do. We ended up hiring paddleboard one afternoon,
paddling out to the local islands, went snorkelling, scuba diving, and visited a lagoon
and viewpoint along one of the most extraordinary paths I’ve ever been on. If you’re in
the area, pop over to the Prha Nang viewpoint/lagoon. Don’t take shoes you don’t mind
getting filthy. Bare feet was a good call, along with not taking anything with us, leaving
hands free to assist climbing and descending the path.</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>

<p>Thailand for me was a daunting place to begin with, and had it not been for travelling
with someone that knew the customs/way around the city - I would probably have had a
very different experience. The fastest way into the city is by the Sky Train (also the
fastest way around the city - but can be very busy). Most people pay for the Sky Train
tickets with coins (for speed), but if you only have notes, some machines do accept them,
and if not, there are offices where staff will sell you tickets and accept notes.</p>

<h3 id="tuk-tuks">Tuk Tuks</h3>

<p>Are immensely fun. Also you can get ripped off pretty easily. Its easy to forget the
difference in living costs in Bangkok, and therefore feeling that £4/5 is pretty reasonable
for a ride across town. The drivers will often say double than what you should be paying,
so its worth haggling the price down with them. If they are offering a deal that seems
too good to be true (10 baht each for an hour ride was what we were offered), its because
it is. The drivers often have deals with attractions/shops, and they will take you on
a convoluted route, dropping you at a shop where you’re pressured into buying things.
Specify that you want to go straight to your destination.</p>

<h3 id="taxisuber">Taxi’s/Uber</h3>

<p>Taxi’s are also a good way to get around, and not too expensive. Just check that they
are a metered taxi (otherwise a sure-fire way to get ripped off). If you’re tech savvy,
we found that Uber was one of the nicest ways to get around.</p>

<h3 id="climbing">Climbing</h3>

<p>Initially, we had decided to bring all of our climbing stuff, and the day before setting
out, changed our minds about bringing a rope. This was <strong>such</strong> a good call. There are
plenty of shops that will let you rent a rope - avoiding having to lug it around with you
everywhere (which in the heat is mightily unpleasant). We did decide to bring our own
harnesses/shoes/draws though, and as they don’t weigh much, would probably do the same in
the future.</p>

<p>If you can’t find a guidebook anywhere online/in shops, the climbing shops here will let
you rent them out, and they have up to date information about quality of routes/bolts etc.</p>

<h3 id="getting-around-krabi">Getting Around Krabi</h3>

<p>The longtail boats are really the only option for getting to and from Ao Nang/Krabi and
Tonsai/Railay. They cost 100 baht per person, are non-negotiable, and for the first few
trips, a pretty cool experience. There are no roads to Tonsai or Railay, so when you’re
there, you either boat, or walk to wherever you want to go.</p>
